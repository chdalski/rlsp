## Goal

Fix all 24 remaining formatter round-trip conformance
failures and close the fixture gap for interacting settings
combinations. After this plan, every non-fail case in the
yaml-test-suite should round-trip through the formatter
without producing unparseable or empty output.

Acceptance criterion: 0 formatter round-trip failures.
The formatter conformance test
(`rlsp-yaml/tests/formatter_conformance.rs`) has 80
known-failure entries across 70 unique test case stems
(see `KNOWN_FAILURES` allowlist). All must be resolved
— the allowlist must be empty when the plan completes.

## Context

### Current conformance state

Parser: 351/351 (100%). The formatter conformance test
(`rlsp-yaml/tests/formatter_conformance.rs`) has **80
known-failure entries** across 70 unique test case stems.
This is the authoritative list — earlier audit estimates
of 24-27 were based on a temporary measurement that
missed cases. The `KNOWN_FAILURES` allowlist in
`formatter_conformance.rs` is the source of truth.

Measured after the `2026-04-14-formatter-bug-fixes.md`
plan which fixed block scalar indentation, anchors,
single_quote key quoting, tags, and comment loss.

### Failure inventory (24 unparseable + 3 empty)

**Category 1: Double-quoted escape sequences decoded and
unquoted (2 cases)**
- G4RS — `control: "\b1998\t1999"` decoded to raw bytes
- 6SLA — `"foo\nbar:baz"` decoded, newline splits key

Root cause: `node_to_doc` Scalar branch for DoubleQuoted
style calls `needs_quoting` on the *decoded* value. If
`needs_quoting` returns false, the scalar is emitted
plain — but the decoded value may contain characters that
are not representable in a plain scalar (control chars,
newlines). The fix: when a double-quoted scalar contains
escape sequences that decode to non-printable or
structural characters (`\n`, `\t`, `\b`, `\0`, `\\`,
`\"`, etc.), always preserve double-quoting.

**Category 2: Block scalar explicit indentation indicator
stripped (2 cases)**
- F6MC — `a: >2` (explicit indent 2) becomes `a: >`
- 5GBF — folded scalar with tab-only blank line

Root cause: `repr_block_to_doc` emits the chomp indicator
but ignores the explicit indentation indicator digit. The
parser's `ScalarStyle::Literal(Chomp)` / `Folded(Chomp)`
does not carry the indentation indicator. Either the parser
needs to pass it through, or the formatter needs to
compute the minimum content indentation and emit the
indicator when required (content starts with space or tab).

**Category 3: Multiline double-quoted scalars with
document markers in content (3 cases)**
- 9MQT — `"a\n...x\nb"` — `...` in content treated as
  doc marker
- KSS4 — `"quoted\nstring"` on `---` line
- 6WPF/TL85 — flow folding with leading/trailing whitespace

Root cause: the formatter decodes the double-quoted string
and emits it as plain or re-quoted, but the decoded
multiline content contains `---` or `...` at line start,
which the parser interprets as document markers. Fix:
preserve double-quoting for multiline double-quoted
scalars, or escape document-marker-like lines.

**Category 4: Tags on root nodes / explicit-key mappings
misrendered (4 cases)**
- 2XXW — `!!set` with `?`-only keys
- 35KP — `!!map` with `? a\n: b` explicit keys
- J7PZ — `!!omap` with complex values
- M2N8 — `? : x` empty explicit key

Root cause: the formatter does not support explicit key
syntax (`? key\n: value`). It renders all mappings as
`key: value` pairs, which collapses the structure when
the key is complex or the mapping uses `?`-only form
(sets). Tags on these root-level special forms get
concatenated with the first entry.

**Category 5: Anchor/property placement on block
collections (3 cases)**
- 3R3P — `&seq\n- a` — anchor before block sequence
  inlined as `&seq - a`
- PW8X — anchors on empty scalars produce duplicate
  anchor errors
- KK5P — explicit block mappings with nested sequences

Root cause: `node_to_doc` prepends `&anchor ` as inline
text, but block sequences/mappings need the anchor on a
separate line or before the first indicator. The current
`prepend_node_properties` concatenation doesn't account
for block-level placement.

**Category 6: Empty-key mappings (2 cases)**
- NKF9 — `: empty key` and `{ : empty key }` in flow
- V9D5 — compact block mappings with `? key: val`

Root cause: the formatter doesn't handle the empty-key
case (`Node::Scalar { value: "", .. }` as a mapping key)
or the compact block mapping form.

**Category 7: Multiline plain scalars with tabs (2 cases)**
- NB6Z — tab-only blank line in multiline plain scalar
- RZP5/XW4D — multiline plain + trailing comments +
  explicit keys interaction

Root cause: multiline plain scalars that span multiple
lines in the source are loaded as a single string by the
parser. The formatter emits them as a single-line value,
which may exceed print width or lose structural whitespace.

**Category 8: Comment-only / doc-end documents → empty
output (3 cases)**
- 98YD — `# Comment only.`
- HWV9 — `...` bare document-end
- QT73 — `# comment\n...`

Root cause: `format_yaml` calls `load()` which returns
empty documents for comment-only or `...`-only input. The
formatter produces an empty string. Comments are extracted
by `extract_doc_prefix_comments` but only reattached if
there's formatted content to attach them to.

### Fixture gap: settings interaction coverage

`YamlFormatOptions` has 8 settings. Existing fixtures test
each in isolation but no combinations. Interacting pairs
to cover (settings that affect the same formatting
decision):

- `single_quote` + `yaml_version` — quoting decision
  depends on both (V1.1 reserved words + quote style)
- `single_quote` + `format_enforce_block_style` — flow
  collections converted to block, then values quoted
- `bracket_spacing` + `print_width` — flow collections
  with spacing may break differently at narrow widths
- `bracket_spacing` + `format_enforce_block_style` —
  spacing irrelevant when block enforced (should be no-op)
- `format_enforce_block_style` + `print_width` — block
  style means no line-breaking in flow collections
- `use_tabs` + `tab_width` — tab indentation width

## Tasks

### Task 1: Move yaml-test-suite to shared location and add formatter conformance test

Move the vendored yaml-test-suite from
`rlsp-yaml-parser/tests/yaml-test-suite/` to a shared
workspace-level directory `tests/yaml-test-suite/` so both
`rlsp-yaml-parser` and `rlsp-yaml` can reference the same
data without symlinks or duplication.

Add a permanent formatter conformance test to `rlsp-yaml`
that runs alongside the fixture tests in CI.

- [x] Create `tests/yaml-test-suite/` at workspace root
- [x] Move (not copy) the vendored data from
      `rlsp-yaml-parser/tests/yaml-test-suite/` to
      `tests/yaml-test-suite/`
- [x] Update `rlsp-yaml-parser/tests/conformance.rs`
      `#[files]` path to reference `../tests/yaml-test-suite/src/*.yaml`
- [x] Verify parser conformance still passes (351/351)
- [x] Create `rlsp-yaml/tests/formatter_conformance.rs`:
  - rstest `#[files]` over `../tests/yaml-test-suite/src/*.yaml`
  - For each non-fail case: `format_yaml(input)` must
    parse cleanly via `parse_yaml`, and formatting must
    be idempotent (`format(format(input)) == format(input)`)
  - Maintain an allowlist of known-failing case IDs
    (the 24 unparseable + 3 empty cases) — test passes
    if a case is on the allowlist and fails, or not on
    the allowlist and passes
  - Test FAILS if: a non-allowlisted case fails
    (regression) or an allowlisted case passes (remove
    it from the list — the test enforces shrinking the
    allowlist)
- [x] Populate the allowlist with the 27 currently-failing
      case IDs
- [x] `cargo test` passes for both crates
- [x] `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean

### Task 2: Fix double-quoted escape sequence handling (Cat 1) — `987aa89`

Preserve double-quoting on scalars whose decoded content
contains non-printable characters, structural characters,
or escape sequences that cannot be represented in plain
YAML.

- [x] In `node_to_doc` Scalar/DoubleQuoted branch, check
      if the decoded value contains characters that require
      double-quoting beyond what `needs_quoting` catches
      (control chars, newlines, tabs, backslashes, etc.)
- [x] When such characters are present, always emit as
      double-quoted with proper escaping via
      `escape_double_quoted`
- [x] Extend `escape_double_quoted` if needed to handle
      all YAML 1.2 §5.7 escape sequences
- [x] Add fixtures for affected patterns
- [x] Remove fixed entries from KNOWN_FAILURES allowlist
- [x] Cases: G4RS, 6SLA, CPZ3, NAT4
- [x] `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets` pass

### Task 3: Fix block scalar indentation indicators — `826d008`

Preserve or compute the explicit indentation indicator
digit on block scalars whose content starts with leading
spaces or tabs.

- [x] Check if the parser's `ScalarStyle` carries the
      indentation indicator — if not, compute it from the
      scalar content (minimum leading whitespace of
      non-empty lines)
- [x] In `repr_block_to_doc`, emit the indentation
      indicator digit when content requires it (first
      content line starts with space or tab)
- [x] Add fixtures for affected patterns
- [x] Remove fixed entries from KNOWN_FAILURES allowlist
- [x] Cases: F6MC, 5GBF, P2AD, R4YG, 4QFQ, T26H, MJS9,
      TS54, 2G84
- [x] `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets` pass

`: value` explicit key form — needed for sets (`!!set`),
ordered maps (`!!omap`), complex keys, and empty keys.

      form: complex key (mapping/sequence as key), empty
      key, or tagged root mapping with `?`-only entries
- [ ] Render explicit keys as `? key\n: value` instead of
      `key: value`
- [ ] Handle `!!set` (sequence of `?`-only entries)

      Y79Y, 26DV
- [ ] `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets` pass

### Task 9: Handle comment-only and doc-end documents

Ensure comment-only documents and bare document-end
markers produce non-empty output.

- [ ] In `format_yaml`, handle the case where `load()`
      returns empty documents but prefix comments exist
- [ ] Emit standalone comments when no document content
      exists
- [ ] Handle bare `...` document-end markers
- [ ] Add fixtures for affected patterns
- [ ] Remove fixed entries from KNOWN_FAILURES allowlist
- [ ] Cases: 98YD, HWV9, QT73, MUS6, 6LVF, 6WLZ, W4TN
      (6ZKB and 9DXL are Cat 9 — multi-document streams)
- [ ] `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets` pass

### Task 10: Fix multi-document stream handling (Cat 9)

Fix formatter handling of multi-document streams with
`---`/`...` separators, trailing comments between
documents, and trailing whitespace in streams.

Cases: JHB9, 6XDY, L383, JEF9, 6ZKB, 9DXL

- [ ] `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets` pass

### Task 12: Fix tags on complex structures (Cat 11)

Fix formatter handling of global tags and tagged complex
documents (e.g., `!foo` custom tags on multi-feature
documents like the YAML spec Invoice example).

Cases: C4HZ, UGM3

- [ ] Handle global tag handles (`%TAG` + shorthand tags)
- [ ] Handle complex tagged documents with anchors, aliases,
      explicit keys, and block scalars (UGM3 Invoice)
- [ ] Remove fixed entries from KNOWN_FAILURES allowlist
- [ ] Add fixtures for representative patterns
- [ ] `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets` pass

### Task 13: Add interacting-settings fixture combinations

Add fixtures that test combinations of settings that
interact (affect the same formatting decision).

- [ ] `single_quote` + `yaml_version` — V1.1 keyword
      with single-quote preference
- [ ] `single_quote` + `format_enforce_block_style` —
      flow-to-block conversion with single-quote values
- [ ] `bracket_spacing` + `print_width` — narrow width
      with flow collections and spacing
- [ ] `bracket_spacing` + `format_enforce_block_style` —
      spacing irrelevant when block enforced
- [ ] `format_enforce_block_style` + `print_width` —
      block style ignores width for collections
- [ ] `use_tabs` + `tab_width` — tab indentation with
      custom tab width
- [ ] `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets` pass

### Task 14: Final conformance verification

Run the full formatter round-trip conformance measurement
and verify 0 failures.

- [ ] Run conformance measurement, record results
- [ ] Target: 0 unparseable, 0 empty output
- [ ] If any failures remain, document root cause and
      determine if they require parser changes (genuine
      blockers) vs formatter changes
- [ ] Update VS Code extension `package.json` and
      `config.ts` to reflect any new or changed settings
      in `YamlFormatOptions` — ensure all user-facing
      formatter settings are exposed in the extension
- [ ] `cargo test` passes
- [ ] `pnpm run build && pnpm run test && pnpm run lint`
      passes in `rlsp-yaml/integrations/vscode/`

## Decisions

- **All fixes in rlsp-yaml only** — `rlsp-fmt` must not
  be modified. If a fix seems to require `rlsp-fmt`
  changes, re-evaluate.
- **Explicit key syntax is the hardest task** — Task 4
  requires adding a rendering mode that doesn't exist in
  the formatter yet. It should be tackled after the
  simpler escape/quoting fixes.
- **No parser changes for formatter round-trips** — the
  parser is 351/351 conformant. If formatted output doesn't
  round-trip, the formatter must emit a different valid
  form — not modify the parser. Parser changes are only
  valid for genuine parser bugs (incorrect parse, loader
  data loss) or surfacing info already in the event stream.
  See Crate Boundaries in root `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Reviewer actively bug-hunts** — same directive as the
  previous plan.
- **Acceptance criterion is 0 failures** — no silent
  weakening. If a case genuinely cannot be fixed without
  major architectural work, it must be presented to the
  user for explicit approval before being deferred.
