- **`autoWrapFlowStyle` opt-out for `block_to_flow`** — The code-action user-format-config plan (`.ai/plans/2026-04-27-code-action-respect-user-format-config.md`) sets `block_to_flow`'s default to auto-wrap output to fit `formatPrintWidth`, removing the misleading `(long line)` title suffix. If users later report wanting single-line flow output regardless of length (e.g., for tooling that prefers compact JSON-like flow), add a setting like `autoWrapFlowStyle: false` (default `true`) so the action emits unwrapped flow when the user opts out. Defer until evidence shows demand — pre-emptively shipping the setting risks configuration sprawl across all code actions. Bias: do nothing unless a user explicitly asks for it.

- **Expand corpus beyond the 4 seed files** — Move 0 seeded the corpus with `release-plz-workflow.yml`, `kubernetes-deployment.yaml`, `docker-compose.yml`, `github-actions-matrix.yml`. Real-world YAML covers many more shapes: Ansible playbooks, Helm chart templates, GitLab CI pipelines, CloudFormation/CDK YAML, Prometheus alert rules, SOPS-encrypted files, Swagger/OpenAPI specs, Argo CD `Application` manifests, Flux CD `Kustomization`s, Tekton `Pipeline`/`Task` resources. Each adds new coverage. File as one plan per shape, or a batch-add plan for 3-5 at a time. Each new file may surface new I4 failures that flag latent bugs — treat those under the Surprise Failure Protocol.

<!-- Surfaced during the 2026-07-23 dependabot-followup plan
     (`.ai/plans/2026-07-23-dependabot-followup-ci-and-security-maintenance.md`).
     All three were verified out-of-scope for that overrides/CI-config plan. -->

- **`dtolnay/rust-toolchain` refs pin mutable branches, not tags or SHAs.**
  All 8 workflow refs use `@1.97.1`, which resolves a *branch* the action
  pre-creates ahead of the actual Rust release (this is the same
  branches-as-versions behavior that produced the fictional-`1.100.0` PR #50
  and prompted the dependabot `ignore` rule in that plan). A mutable branch
  ref is re-resolvable and violates the project convention in
  `.claude/rules/github-workflows.md` (pin to version tags, not SHAs — but
  these are neither). Consider pinning to commit SHAs (with a comment naming
  the version) or accept the branch pin deliberately. Low urgency; the pin is
  bumped manually in lockstep, so drift is bounded. Verify the current
  pinning posture before acting — this note reflects 2026-07-23 state.

- **`packageManager` field may warrant a `+<integrity>` hash.** Task 4 made CI
  resolve pnpm from `rlsp-yaml/integrations/vscode/package.json`'s
  `"packageManager": "pnpm@10.33.2"`. `pnpm/action-setup` supports (and
  strips) an optional `+<sha512...>` integrity suffix. The security advisor
  rated adding one **low-severity / non-blocking**. If pursued, confirm the
  action's current handling and that the hash matches the intended pnpm
  release.

- **`overrides.test.ts` accumulated test surface — consolidation candidate.**
  The brace-expansion/fast-uri security-guard file has been touched by four
  sequential plans (the three 2026-08-07 overrides/advisory plans plus
  `2026-08-10-vscode-dep-bumps-minus-ts7-and-ci-gates.md` Task 2). It now
  carries CRLF-normalization helper tests and lockfile-parity tests alongside
  the security-guard assertions (~224 lines). Now that `.gitattributes` pins
  `pnpm-lock.yaml` to LF at checkout, review whether the CRLF-fixture and
  lockfile-parity `describe` blocks still earn their keep or should be
  trimmed/merged. Surfaced by the plan-review of the 2026-08-10 dep-bumps plan
  and deliberately kept out of that plan's scope to preserve the dep-bump
  slice's atomicity. Bias: trim only if it clearly reduces surface without
  losing a real robustness property.
