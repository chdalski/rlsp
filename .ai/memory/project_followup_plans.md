- **`autoWrapFlowStyle` opt-out for `block_to_flow`** — The code-action user-format-config plan (`.ai/plans/2026-04-27-code-action-respect-user-format-config.md`) sets `block_to_flow`'s default to auto-wrap output to fit `formatPrintWidth`, removing the misleading `(long line)` title suffix. If users later report wanting single-line flow output regardless of length (e.g., for tooling that prefers compact JSON-like flow), add a setting like `autoWrapFlowStyle: false` (default `true`) so the action emits unwrapped flow when the user opts out. Defer until evidence shows demand — pre-emptively shipping the setting risks configuration sprawl across all code actions. Bias: do nothing unless a user explicitly asks for it.

- **Expand corpus beyond the 4 seed files** — Move 0 seeded the corpus with `release-plz-workflow.yml`, `kubernetes-deployment.yaml`, `docker-compose.yml`, `github-actions-matrix.yml`. Real-world YAML covers many more shapes: Ansible playbooks, Helm chart templates, GitLab CI pipelines, CloudFormation/CDK YAML, Prometheus alert rules, SOPS-encrypted files, Swagger/OpenAPI specs, Argo CD `Application` manifests, Flux CD `Kustomization`s, Tekton `Pipeline`/`Task` resources. Each adds new coverage. File as one plan per shape, or a batch-add plan for 3-5 at a time. Each new file may surface new I4 failures that flag latent bugs — treat those under the Surprise Failure Protocol.
